    <h2>My Life (So Far!)</h2>

         <p>I was born on September 20th, 2003 in St. Vincent hospital, located in Hillsboro, Oregon. My sister was the one who chose to name me, and ended up naming me after a character in a book: Jamie. My family consists of my mom, my dad, my grandparents, and my sister. My mom is a hairstylist and she sews cosmetic bags as well as various other things for different companies. My dad is retired, and my grandparents used to be farmers before they moved to the U.S. Now, they help my mom out with her sewing work, along with my dad. My sister is an artist. She currently works for a game company and does 3D modeling. Still, she knows plenty about fine arts, and loves her job. I started school at around age 5/6 in 2008 at Imlay Elementary. During this time, I began to really enjoy drawing. I always drew with pencils and crayons, and it soon became one of the only things I did-- besides playing video games. However, my family greatly discouraged this. They believed that a job in the arts would not make money, and were very traditional in how they had raised me. Also, I was a very quiet (and quite frankly, odd) kid. I didn't socialize very much, and didn't really have solid friends until later on in my life. Imlay was a k-6th grade school, and once I completed 6th grade, I went onto Brown Middle School. I spent my 7th and 8th grade year there, and this is where I began to play alto saxophone for the band. I started saxophone on an old Bundy I borrowed from Mr. Carr, and did jazz band in 8th grade year. Of course, I continued with art, practicing digital arts on my computer with my Wacom tablet at this time. Also, I began to find interest in gothic themes/horror. I would discover cosmic/psychological horror later (still love it to this day!), but during my days at Brown, I really loved trad goth. Joy Division, Bauhaus, New Order, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and The Cure were a few of my favorite bands at the time. Furthermore, I rekindled my love for metal from 5/6th grade, and began to really enjoy Iron Maiden, Death, etc.

         <p>Today, I attend Century High School at the fresh age of 16. Once high school rolled around, I began to experiment with computer science. I began with Intro to Digital Tech, and discovered that I was incredibly interested in drafting and computer science. Since I didn't have room for drafting classes, I chose to go into computing. Around this time, I went to a Kode with Klossy summercamp for mobile applications, and learned quite a bit about working in Swift and Git. I even made my first completed game there. It was a pretty simple one: a visual novel game based entirely on segues and a searchbar. Even though it was super simple, it was very fun to make. To this day I am still working hard at computer science, art, and band. I found a massive love for jazz, and am now in Century's Jazz 2 band. I have marched Medusa with the band last year, and am now working on our new show: Illuminate. In addition, I have continued my art education here in Art 3 and am now making my best attempt at learning game design and web design. I still live with my parents, and am happily attending school with big dreams. Let's hope I don't end up dropping out.

    <h2>My Passions</h2>

        <p>So far, I really love music and the arts. I mostly play alto saxophone and I enjoy playing jazz the most, however, soloing and improvisation makes me incredibly nervous. Learning it on my own is fine, but, performing it is a big no-no to me. That's the irony of it-- I have terrible stage fright, and chord changes are the devil's creation. I've dabbled in other instruments, such as piano, bass, and guitar. Piano was my mom's doing-- she had a client who taught lessons, and she used it to her advantage. I taught myself bass and guitar at home on my own. Sadly, these didn't stick that well. I still love the instruments and tinker with them, but I mostly just play saxophone out of requirement. If I don't I'll fail my band classes, for sure. 
        </p>

        <p>I have grown out of doing only digital art and am now working in multiple mediums. Lately, I have especially enjoyed sketching with markers, pencils (colored and graphite/charcoal), and painting in acrylic/gouache. I have also touched watercolor and oil painting quite a bit, as well as pure charcoal. However, I lack the patience to do those as often as my other favorite mediums. Watercolor takes too long to dry, and oil paints are too much of a hassle to prepare. I also want to continue doing more graphic design, especially since I am working in web design now, but I haven't quite had the time. I'm hoping that web design will make up for this when I learn how to style with CSS. Since I am doing Art 3 in school, I've also had to jump out of my comfort zone of subjects. We are abstracting and exploring creativity, but I personally want to learn more figure drawing and fundamentals. 
        </p>

        <p>A newer passion is computer science. I haven't done much to practice it outside of school-- since I don't know what to do-- but in school, I work hard for it. Right now I'm learning game design and web design. I know Swift, HTML, a smidge of Python/C#, and how to use Git. Most of this came from going to the Kode with Klossy summer camp, as well as my classes at Century. So far, I think that programming and designing are very fun. I've already made a couple of baby web pages (this one included) as well as a couple of Unity creator kit games! The frustration is real, but the reward of completion pays off.

    <h2>My Dreams</h2>

        <p>When I was younger, my biggest dream was to do art in the future. I desperately wanted to do character art, concept art, landscapes, fine art, you name it! Even graphic design, one of <i>the</i> most tedious forms of art, piqued my interest. The arts are still a major interest of mine, and I hope that in the future I'll be able to get myself some type of art education. Not to say that I'll be going to an art school, that'll only happen if I have the money! Art schools tend to be incredibly expensive, so for now, I'll save it for later. Besides, art school is really only for connections. A lot of professional artists say that you don't need art school in order to do art, and they're right. All you need is to know what you're doing, and I dream of being able to confidently work with this knowledge. 
        </p>

        <p>Nowadays, I see that art isn't a very good hobby to turn into a singular job for me. My family won't be able to help me financially in the future, since my dad is already retired and my mom will be on her way when I'm in college. Thus, I want to do computer science and get a job in this field in the future. My dream is to work somewhere in Oregon's silicon forest, and to use the money I get from this to fund my arts. In addition, I want to combine computer science and my art into something that I enjoy and pays well. Web design and game design are two great examples. 
        </p>

        <P>Overall, my dream is just to be successful and to be happy. I want a dog, I want to have friends, but most of all I want to do something with my life that I am happy with. No office jobs for me!
        </P>
